We can copy the objects using copy constructor.
But it takes more processing time due to new keyword.

So we can use clone method of Object class.
We must implement Cloneable interface in the class whose object we want to clone.
If we do not implement cloneable interface than JVM will throw CloneNotSupportedException.
And also override clone() method which throws CloneNotSupportedException.
This creates a shallow copy.

Shallow Copy
It creates copy for primitive type variables but non-primitive point to same reference as first object.
This is not pure copy.

Deep Copy
It creates copy of both primitive data types and objects.
