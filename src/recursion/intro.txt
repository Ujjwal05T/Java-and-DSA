When a function is recursively calls itself then this function is called recursive function and this process is called recursion.

We have to put a condition where recursion stops.This condition is called base condition.

Every time recursive function calls itself it will take memory in stack memory.

If we do not put base condition then function will run infinitely and will give stack overflow error.

Why Recursion ?

=> It helps us in solving bigger problems in simpler way.We can convert recursive solution to iterative solution and vice versa.
   It helps in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems.


When we write recursion in the formula it is called recurrence relation.

The base condition is represented by answers we already know.

When last step in a function is recursive call then it is called tail recursion.
